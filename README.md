# simplest-loophole-free
Supplemental code for "Detection-loophole-free nonlocality in the simplest scenario".

-Python files reproduce the tolerable noise-efficiency tradeoffs for Bell nonlocality, for all two qubit states (eberhard_determinant.py) and restricting to maximally entangled states (eberhard_determinant_singlet.py).
-Mathematica notebook solves the systems of equations used to derive optimal steering inequalities in Section II of the Supplemental Material.
